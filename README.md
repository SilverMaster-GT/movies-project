A free Vuetify 3 theme using Vite.

![version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.0.0-green.svg)

**Ejercicio site movies** ejercicio realizado utilizando [Vuejs](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/), [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) and [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/).

## Getting Started

- Run `npm install` to install the project's dependencies
- Run `npm dev` to start a local development server

You can also run additional tasks such as

- `npm run build` to build your app for production
- `npm run serve` to serve your production app
- `npm run lint` to run linting.

## Vuetify

Vuetify is an Open Source UI Library that is developed exactly according to Material Design spec. Every component is handcrafted to bring you the best possible UI tools to your next great app. The development doesn't stop at the core components outlined in Google's spec. Through the support of community members and sponsors, additional components will be designed and made available for everyone to enjoy.

The documentation for **Vuetify** is hosted [here](https://vuetifyjs.com/).

***Not all components that are available in this project are part of the theme and may be a default Vuetify component***

## Vite

Vite is a build tool that significantly improves the front-end development experience. You can use Vite to set up a development environment for frameworks like Vue and React, and even for a vanilla JavaScript app with a dev server and hot reloading in just three commands. It also easily integrates with [TypeScript](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#typescript).

## Vue-cli

We use the latest 3.x [Vue CLI](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli) which aims to reduce project configuration
to as little as possible. Almost everything is inside `package.json` + some other related files such as
`.babel.config.js`, `.eslintrc.js` and `.postcssrc.js`.

Let us know what you think and what we can improve below. And good luck with development!
